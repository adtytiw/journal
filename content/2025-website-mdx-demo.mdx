This post demonstrates the various features available in my blog, thanks to MDX and custom components.

## Headings, Lists, and Links

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- Lists
- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- [Links](https://youtube.com/)

## Code Blocks

```js
function hello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```


## Live Code Sandbox

<LiveCode code={`<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`} language="html" />


## Tweet Embeds

<Tweet id="1354143047324299264" />

## Images

<img src="/images/zoo2.webp" alt="A sample image from the public folder" style={{ maxHeight: '320px', width: 'auto', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '1.5rem 0' }} />

## Custom Components

You can use custom React components, like the code sandbox above, or even more advanced ones.
